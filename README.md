<h3>A Harry Potter information app created with React</h3>

Our goal for this project was to work collaboratively to create an informative app using React and APIs.

We planned what we wanted our app to look like and what functionality and features we wanted it to have.
We used an agile approach to create this project, allowing us to achieve realistic goals and targets whilst also being able to add features time permitting.
Git and GitHub were used so we could collaberate with each other remotely.
The backend was created first, using an API to source our information and creating the different pages to display relevent information. We then focussed on displaying specific information. CSS was added to the entire app to get a basic layout of how we wanted it to look, and then was fine tuned for each page.

Looking back I would like to condense some of the pages down to display less items, although this can be achieved by using drop down menu for some options.
I would also like to add some more images or colours specific on the item selected by the viewer.
